Currently, Mexico does not require visas from citizens of the U.S., Canada, Japan, the Schengen area, the UK, and the Pacific Alliance countries (Chile, Peru, Colombia). Despite rumors, there is no law or bill proposing visa requirements or mass deportations. While Mexico has made visa changes for air transit passengers, these do not affect citizens from countries exempt from visa requirements. The issue of digital nomads has been acknowledged by López Obrador, highlighting challenges like service and housing price increases, and gentrification in cities like Mérida, Oaxaca, and Mexico City. The video suggests a need for greater regulation of digital nomads to prevent negative impacts on local residents without deterring investment, emphasizing the importance of hospitality towards tourists and foreigners while cautioning against the harmful effects of misinformation on tourism and public perception.
